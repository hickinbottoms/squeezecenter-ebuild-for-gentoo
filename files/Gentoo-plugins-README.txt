The standard SqueezeCenter package is installed differently on Gentoo in order
that the installation complies with Gentoo's filesystem layout. These notes
are provided to give guidance for installing plugins within this modified
layout.

INSTALLING PLUGINS

The installation instructions of plugins should be followed but with the
following Gentoo specifics:

* Plugins should be installed into the directory:
  /var/lib/squeezecenter/Plugins
* Extension binaries (which sometimes accompany plugins) should be installed
  into the directory:
  /usr/lib/squeezecenter/Bin
