The "stage" subdirectory contains an image of the ebuild tree. If you want to
try this version of the ebuild out then installing this stage directory is the
most convenient way of doing it.

1. Copy "stage" to "/usr/local/portage/media-sound/squeezecenter"

2. Generate the "manifest" file for the ebuild:
      ebuild /usr/local/portage/media-sound/squeezecenter/sq* digest

3. Ensure that /etc/make.conf includes the local Portage tree so that this
   makefile is found. Do that with a line such as the following:
      PORTDIR_OVERLAY="$PORTDIR_OVERLAY /usr/local/portage"

4. Unmask the ebuild (since it is probably marked as unstable) with a line
   like the following in /etc/portage/package.keywords:
      /media-sound/squeezecenter ~x86

5. Install the package as normal with a command such as:
      emerge -aDvt squeezecenter  

Once you have done this once you can update to later versions of the ebuild by
just redoing steps 1 and 2.


Enjoy.
